        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A super-easy, hearty vegetarian vegetable soup that is almost stew-like in its thickness. Best served with warm, whole-grain bread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>4 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch rounds</li>
            <li>2 baking potatoes, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen corn</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen shelled edamame (green soybeans)</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen sliced okra</li>
            <li>2 leaves kale, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and celery in hot oil until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir garlic into the onion mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Pour vegetable broth and tomato sauce into pot. Simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir carrots and potatoes through the broth. Simmer until carrots are tender, 10 to 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Drop corn, edamame, okra, and kale into the soup. Continue to simmer until okra is tender, 5 to 10 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
